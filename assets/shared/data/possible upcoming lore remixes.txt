CaseOh Mix (though the idea I have for it would fit more for a Bite mix (BITE ORIGINS DLC??))
Prange Mix (Might be my favorite chromatic scale, and with After Midnight, I really wanna play around with the new sprites)
Swagmoney Mix (I've never done swagmoney kinda beat so I would love to try it out)
