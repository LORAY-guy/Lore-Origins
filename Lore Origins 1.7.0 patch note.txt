PS: The new Vloo Guy mode is a test for now, I've implemented it here for feedback on whether or not
I should change the entire cast or only the "guy" and "phone guy" depending on the selected Ourple variant.

Yes, you read that right, depending on the selected Ourple variant, which means, more Ourple alikes will soon be added to the roaster.
If you are the director of any Ourple related mod and want your ourple to be part of the next update, contact me on Discord (loray_man) or on Twitter.

If you want to try Vloo guy, the only songs available for him (for now) are Action (cover) and Lore Sad Mix (original).
You can still use all the different Ourple Guy Skins throughout all the different covers/songs.
