NEW OURPLES ADDED TO THE LORE ROASTER -> Hrey Guy, Nuu Guy, Bloxxy Guy, Wink Woman, Blink Dude and Cool Buddy.

Soon, the mod is going to welcome multiple Ourple Guy Variants as skins and will change the gameplay for even more content.
If you are the director of any Ourple related mod and want your ourple to be part of the next update, contact me on Discord (loray_man) or on Twitter (https://x.com/LORAY_man).
(That is if I ever consider making another update...)

IMPORTANT NOTE : If Chronology crashes, it's actually normal, the thing is I added so many events to it that the game literally crashes because of how many there are (that's my theory anyway, cuz everything should be working fine).

ADDITIONAL NOTE: If you are having performance issues, I recommand disabling the miscellanous events in the Lore Origins settings.
