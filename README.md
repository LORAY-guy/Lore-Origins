# AFTER 7 MONTHS OF WORK, I AM HAPPY TO FINALLY RELEASE THE 2.0 UPDATE!

## WHAT IS LORE ORIGINS?

Lore Origins is an FNF mod that regroups the entire lore multiverse. The original track, made by LEX3X (aka kiwiquest), got so much praized for its authenticity and has become one of the most remixed song ever composed. This mod is an honor to this wonderful track that, basically, changed my life (for the better... or worse...).

This collection of lore remixes are repurposed for its original cast of singers, Ourple Guy, Matpat and Phone Guy, as an hope to fix the multiple parallel universes that each of those songs created...

---

NEW OURPLES ADDED TO THE LORE ROASTER -> Hrey Guy, Nuu Guy, Bloxxy Guy, Wink Woman, Blink Dude and Cool Buddy.

Soon, the mod is going to welcome multiple Ourple Guy Variants as skins and will change the gameplay for even more content.
If you are the director of any Ourple related mod and want your ourple to be part of the next update, contact me on Discord (loray_man) or on Twitter (https://x.com/LORAY_man).
(That is if I ever consider making another update...)

ADDITIONAL NOTE: If you are having performance issues, I recommand disabling the miscellanous events in the Lore Origins settings.
